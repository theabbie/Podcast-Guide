* Paid (Fully)

### Self-hosting

You can otherwise do Self-hosting which would require you to host the Audio Files Somewhere.  

Hosting Audio Files is a difficult task as any hosting provider has a Bandwidth limit. So, just a 50 MB episode will exhaust 100 GB Bandwidth in just 2000 Plays which is not scalable.  

Hosting Audio files requires specific type of services, which are rarely free. If you can find one, that's great. Then you will have to create a Podcast Feed manually or through some tool.
